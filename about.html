<h2 class="content">About Me</h2>
<hr>
<p>Hi, meet George.</p>

<p>George Lesica is a MS student in the department of Computer Science at the
University of Montana and a software engineer. He has previously studied and
taught economics and worked in academic technology. He still isn't sure what he
wants to be when he grows up.</p>

<p>In his free time he enjoys camping, hiking, road biking, arguing on the
Internet, and writing fun code. Once upon a time he was an avid runner and has
been attempting to get back into it of late. So far he enjoys 5Ks, but we'll
see how long that lasts.</p>

<p>Politically he feels people should leave one another alone. Morally he feels
people should stop hurting one another and being generally destructive.
Religiously he believes that whether or not there is a magical space ghost
watching over us we should probably just get on with our lives.</p>

<p>He also thoroughly enjoys third-person autobiographical sketches.</p>
