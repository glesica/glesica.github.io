<h1 class="title">COMPUTERS</h1>
</header>
<p>I’ve been collecting old computers for several years now. I’m primarily interested in the industrial design of the machines and how it has evolved over the years. It is then, perhaps, no coincidence that Apple features prominently in my collection, given the company’s traditional focus on design. That being said, there are certainly exceptions, and some of my computers are more about sentiment than anything else, particularly the ones I used as a child (this helps to explain the Commodore 64).</p>
