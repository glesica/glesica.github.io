<h1 class="title">COMPUTERS</h1>
</header>
<p>I’ve been collecting old computers for several years now. I’m
primarily interested in the industrial design of the machines and how it
has evolved over the years. It is then, perhaps, no coincidence that
Apple features prominently in my collection, given the company’s
traditional focus on design. That being said, there are certainly
exceptions, and some of my computers are more about sentiment than
anything else, particularly the ones I used as a child (this helps to
explain the Commodore 64).</p>
<p>This page is a work in progress!</p>

## Commodore 64

The Commodore 64 is the first computer I ever used. My family got one around
1984 (I don't actually remember a time before we had it). Mostly, I played
simple games on it. My dad even made me a controller for one of them!

There are a lot of people around my age who have similar memories and I'm
convinced (along with a lot of other people) that the Commodore 64 played a huge
part in shaping the modern computing industry.

<p>The most interesting thing about the Duo, to me, is the Duo Dock, a
beastly docking station that accepted the entire (closed) laptop like a
disk drive. The dock could be hooked up to an external monitor,
keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals. In addition, the dock contained
hardware to expand the capabilities of the laptop, such as a floating
point unit and additional video memory.</p>

<p>The Newton predicted Apple’s future as a mobile device powerhouse.
Unfortunately for Apple, the device was too expensive to be widely
adopted. There were also problems with the handwriting recognition, its
signature feature. Additionally, in many ways, the world just wasn’t
ready for advanced mobile devices. The Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)
category found some success, but it wasn’t until cellular internet
access became widespread that mobile devices really took off.</p>
<p>One interesting tidbit, the Newton used a CPU designed by Advanced
RISC Machines Ltd., a company that would later rename itself Arm
Ltd. and provide the underlying architecture for the processors inside
the iPhone and the new M1 CPU.</p>

<h2 id="imac-g4">iMac G4</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the greatest desktop computer design of all time. The
LCD is supported by a spring-loaded arm, which makes it trivial to
adjust its position and angle. This was also the first iMac to have an
LCD display.</p>
<p>Released in 2002 and discontinued in 2004 in favor of the modern
slab-style iMac, the innovative design was short-lived. The LCD arm as a
concept, however, is now nearly ubiquitous and this was the first widely
popular instance that I know of.</p>

<p>The 12” model that I own is one of my favorite laptop designs. It
always felt efficient, given that the keyboard went from edge-to-edge. I
also liked the small size, it felt truly portable compared to many of
its contemporaries. In many ways, at least in my mind, this was the
first truly modern laptop.</p>

<p>The original iPad felt like Star Trek come to life when it was
announced. While Microsoft had been trying to make the <a

happen for years, Apple went a different route. The iPad looked, and
operated, more like a smartphone than a laptop.</p>
