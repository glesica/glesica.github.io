Another batch of CS links. Today we have [Grace
Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper) who more or less invented
the compiler (the thing that turns computer code written by programmers into
something the computer can understand, prior to compilers, programmers had to
speak the computer's language, which was just awful). Also, the [origins of the
term "bug"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_bug), used to describe an
error in a piece of software, are rather interesting. Finally, a bit of ancient
history, the [Antikythera
mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism) was a mystery
for many years but is now believe to be a very, very early computational device.
Constructed around 100 BCE it is rather old.
