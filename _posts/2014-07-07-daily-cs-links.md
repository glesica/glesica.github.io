Inspired by a project I'm working on
(<https://github.com/um-tech-evolution/circuits>), today we have [Boolean
Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra), which is similar to
the algebra you learned in school, except that there are only two possible
values: "true" and "false" (or "yes" and "no", or 1 and 0). Concepts from
Boolean Algebra are used widely in computer science to allow computer
programmers to describe choices a computer program should make, and how it
should go about making those choices. Next, sticking with the math theme, we
have [integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer), which are basically
whole numbers. Integers are important to computer scientists for a number of
reasons, the most obvious of which is that integers are the easiest type of
numbers for a computer to "understand". Computer programmers often attempt to
reduce problems so that they involve only integers.
