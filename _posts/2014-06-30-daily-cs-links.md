Today we have [Alonzo Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church) who
made numerous contributions to computer science and mathematics. He is

that forms the basis for functional programming languages such as Lisp.
Switching gears, a [computer
virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus) is one of several kinds of
