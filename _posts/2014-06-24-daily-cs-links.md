Some more links! Today we have [Edsger
Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) (whose name I have
spelled more and more correctly over the years). He developed many important
concepts in computer science related to programming languages and graph
algorithms. He was a professor at the University of Texas until shortly before
his death and many of his writings can still be found [on his web site
there](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/). Finally, we have [Breadth-first
search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search), an algorithm for
finding a path from one node to another node in a graph (or for searching for
something in a graph in an orderly fashion starting at a given node). This
algorithm can be used to solve many interesting problems including the famous
"six degrees of Kevin Bacon" game.
