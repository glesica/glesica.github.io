The first link for today is, perhaps fittingly, the [Linked
List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list), one of a fairly large number
of data structures that allow a programmer to keep track of a list of data items
within a computer program (which is more difficult than it might seem at first).
Next, we have [Donald Knuth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth), a very
famous computer scientist who has been responsible for a number of important
advances in the field. Finally, the [BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC)
programming language is how many programmers today (myself included) first
learned to program computers. It turned 50 this year, and continues to have an
effect on the world through other languages and tools it inspired.
