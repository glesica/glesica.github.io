More CS links! Today we have [Ada
Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), who is widely considered
to be the first computer programmer, having basically invented the concept of
computer programming. Also, a famous location in CS history, [Bletchley
Park](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-27808962), the site
where Alan Turing did much of his work during WW2, has been restored. Finally,
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life), a
fascinating, yet simple, example of emergent behavior and complexity.
