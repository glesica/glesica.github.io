The homepage of George Lesica. I'm a resident of Missoula, MT, one of the most
remarkable cities in the world (in my opinion). I'm a software developer and
recovering economist. I enjoy hiking, running, riding my bike to work, craft
beer, and fancy programming languages.

I also have a page of interesting [quotes](quotes.html). Well, interesting to
me, anyway.

Feel free to reach out via email or LinkedIn if you want to talk. I especially
enjoy helping young people get started in the software industry. I have acted as
a mentor on several occasions and I devote a significant amount of time to
outreach and recruiting. I am also particularly passionate about increasing
diversity and representation in the computing field.

Below you'll find an outline of some of the things that make me "tick".
Projects, either ongoing or complete, with which I am proud to be associated.

## Noteworthy Projects

These are in no particular order and some are ongoing, as you might guess from
the descriptions.

**Founder and Principal, Georgica Software, LLC** - I periodically take on
consulting projects. If you'd like to discuss a project, take a look at my
[business web site](https://georgica.io) or just send me an
[email](mailto:george@lesica.com).

**Pro bono Technology Advisor, Tamarack Grief Resource Center** - I provide
advice and periodic assistance with technology issues for
[TGRC](https://tamarackgrc.org), a non-profit devoted to helping people cope
with tragic loss.

**Instructor, Special Topics - Software Testing (Fall 2018)** - I designed and
taught a special topics course (CSCI 391) on software testing at the University
of Montana. The course covered a variety of topics, most of which are described
in the [online
notes](https://sites.google.com/view/csci391-software-testing/home), related to
software reliability and testing, including some less obvious subjects like
static analysis and type systems. I used the [open source
textbook](https://github.com/laboon/ebook) written by Bill Laboon at CMU, along
with assorted other readings. Currently, I'm planning to deliver an updated,
400-level version of the course for spring 2021.

**Co-organizer, Missoula Tech** - A group of tech industry folks in a wide
variety of roles from across Montana, centered in Missoula, MT. We organize
social, educational, and technical events.  There's also an active Slack
workspace. Come check us out at
[https://missoula.tech/](https://missoula.tech/).

**Co-founder, Code for Montana** - A chapter of the [Code for
America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) organization focused on issues and
problems that are important to Montanans. Right now we're involved in a project
to improve access to, and collaboration between non-profit organizations. You
can check out the code so far on
[GitHub](https://github.com/code-for-montana/nonprofit-data/).

The system to extract and filter IRS data is called PyRS990 (get it?). It has
now been packaged and can be found on PyPI, although is should still be
considered alpha software: [PyRS990](https://pypi.org/project/pyrs990/).

We are also involved in an ongoing project to improve the technical literacy of
staff at local non-profits through personalized training and consultation
provided by tech industry volunteers.

**Co-author, The Economics of Seinfeld** - A web site that uses clips from the
popular '90s sitcom "Seinfeld" to teach economics. The site is used widely at
the high school and university levels and has helped inspire a whole sub-genre
of economics teaching tools based on pop culture. Check out the site at
[http://yadayadayadaecon.com](http://yadayadayadaecon.com) or the
[publication](https://econpapers.repec.org/article/tafjeduce/v_3a42_3ay_3a2011_3ai_3a3_3ap_3a317-318.htm)
in the Journal of Economic Education.

**Co-founder, Datamaglia** - A recommender system startup a friend of mine and I
did awhile back. We built some pretty neat technology on top of a graph database
and got to participate in [Start-Up Chile](https://www.startupchile.org), which
meant that we got to live in Santiago, Chile for about eight months. Alas, we
made mistakes, and while we still think our idea was sound (AWS and Azure have
both launched vaguely similar products in the years since) we didn't get
sufficient traction.

**Open Source Author and Maintainer** - I have written several mildly popular
software packages and I help maintain a rotating cast of other, more popular,
packages. I'm currently the primary maintainer for the
[Testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify/) testing package for the Go
programming language. I originally wrote the [Julia language
driver](https://github.com/glesica/neo4j.jl) for the Neo4j database, although it
has since been forked and improved by others. I also wrote a tool called
[DCDG](https://github.com/glesica/dcdg.dart) that will automatically generate a
class diagram from Dart source code.

## Various Projects

**XL Diff** - a super simple tool that allows the user to check whether datasets
in two Excel files are different or not. Useful for checking whether a data
export has changed or an update has been made to a shared file. It can be found
on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/xldiff/) and the code is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/glesica/xldiff).

## Files and Such

[Software Quality Talk](files/software-quality-talk-spring-2020.pdf) - a talk I
gave to the spring 2020 senior capstone class about some of the techniques we
can use to make software less terrible.

## Day Job

At the moment, I'm employed as a Senior Software Engineer for [Wheeler
Lab](http://wheelerlab.org) at the [University of Montana](http://www.umt.edu).
Most of our work involves applying machine learning techniques to bioinformatics
problems.  In particular, we are working to improve the accuracy of DNA and
protein sequence alignments. This work has broad potential implications in areas
as diverse as agriculture, management of viral epidemics, and the treatment of
genetic disorders.

Much of our code is written by student researchers (undergraduate and graduate)
who have relatively little experience building "real" software. My job is
twofold. First, make sure that the software released by the lab is performant,
free of serious bugs, and readily usable by the broader scientific community.
Second, help ensure that our students achieve their educational, research, and
professional goals and (hopefully) learn a little (or a lot) about software
development in the process.
