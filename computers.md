I've been collecting old computers for several years now. I'm primarily
interested in the industrial design of the machines and how it has evolved over
the years. It is then, perhaps, no coincidence that Apple features prominently
in my collection, given the company's traditional focus on design. That being
said, there are certainly exceptions, and some of my computers are more about
sentiment than anything else, particularly the ones I used as a child (this
helps to explain the Commodore 64).
