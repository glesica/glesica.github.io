I've been collecting old computers for several years now. I'm primarily
interested in the industrial design of the machines and how it has evolved over
the years. It is then, perhaps, no coincidence that Apple features prominently
in my collection, given the company's traditional focus on design. That being
said, there are certainly exceptions, and some of my computers are more about
sentiment than anything else, particularly the ones I used as a child (this
helps to explain the Commodore 64).

This page is a work in progress!

## Commodore 64

The Commodore 64 is the first computer I ever used. My family got one around
1984 (I don't actually remember a time before we had it). Mostly, I played
simple games on it. My dad even made me a controller for one of them!

There are a lot of people around my age who have similar memories and I'm
convinced (along with a lot of other people) that the Commodore 64 played a huge
part in shaping the modern computing industry.

## PowerBook Duo

The most interesting thing about the Duo, to me, is the Duo Dock, a beastly
docking station that accepted the entire (closed) laptop like a disk drive.  The
dock could be hooked up to an external monitor, keyboard, mouse, and other
peripherals. In addition, the dock contained hardware to expand the capabilities
of the laptop, such as a floating point unit and additional video memory.

## iMac G4

In my opinion, the greatest desktop computer design of all time. The LCD is
supported by a spring-loaded arm, which makes it trivial to adjust its position
and angle. This was also the first iMac to have an LCD display.

Released in 2002 and discontinued in 2004 in favor of the modern slab-style
iMac, the innovative design was short-lived. The LCD arm as a concept, however,
is now nearly ubiquitous and this was the first widely popular instance that I
know of.

## iPad

The original iPad felt like Star Trek come to life when it was announced. While
Microsoft had been trying to make the
[tablet PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Tablet_PC) happen for years,
Apple went a different route. The iPad looked, and operated, more like a
smartphone than a laptop.
