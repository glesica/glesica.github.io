<h1 class="title">QUOTES</h1>
</header>
<p>I’m a fan of interesting things that other people have said. I’ve
collected a few of them below. Some are witty, some are wise, and some
are funny (for various reasons). I had a web page like this back in
college and I looked for the files, but alas, they have been lost to the
sands of time and my own carelessness.</p>
<p>I’m going to try to stick to quotes that are off the beaten path. So
no Ben Franklin on liberty, Oppenheimer on the atomic bomb, or Kennedy
on the arts. This has the added benefit of making the page a bit shorter
and easier to update.</p>
<p>I’m also going to try to keep the software development and computer
science quotes to a reasonable number, but we’ll see how that goes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally
for machines to execute.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ Harold Abelson</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Is there a peculiar flavour in what you sprinkle from your torch?”
asked Scrooge.</p>
<p>“There is. My own.”</p>
<p>“Would it apply to any kind of dinner on this day?” asked
Scrooge.</p>
<p>“To any kindly given. To a poor one most.”</p>
<p>“Why to a poor one most?” asked Scrooge.</p>
<p>“Because it needs it most.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has
spun.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ Clifford Geertz</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb if only we dare it
because being American is more than a pride we inherit, it’s the past we
step into and how we repair it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ Amanda Gorman, from The Hill We Climb</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We look at the world once, in childhood. The rest is memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ Louise Glück, Nobel Literature Laureate</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ Charles Goodhart</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by
definition, not smart enough to debug it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ Brian Kernighan</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know people, I know towns, farms, hills and rivers and rocks, I
know how the sun at sunset in autumn falls on the side of a certain
plowland in the hills; but what is the sense of giving a boundary to all
that, of giving it a name and ceasing to love where the name ceases to
apply? What is love of one’s country; is it hate of one’s uncountry?
Then it’s not a good thing. Is it simply self-love? That’s a good thing,
but one mustn’t make a virtue of it, or a profession….</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ Estraven, from The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My candle burns at both ends;<br> It will not last the night;<br> But
ah, my foes, and oh, my friends—<br> It gives a lovely light!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ Edna St. Vincent Millay, First Fig</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your team’s strength is not a function of the talent of individual
members. It’s a function of their collaboration, tenacity, and mutual
respect.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ Jonathan Solórzano-Hamilton</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I wish it need not have happened in my time,” said Frodo. “So do I,”
said Gandalf, “and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not
for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time
that is given us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>~ J.R.R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring</p>
