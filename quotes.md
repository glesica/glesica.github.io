I'm a fan of interesting things that other people have said. I've collected a
few of them below.  Some are witty, some are wise, and some are funny (for
various reasons). I had a web page like this back in college and I looked for
the files, but alas, they have been lost to the sands of time and my own
carelessness.

I'm going to try to stick to quotes that are off the beaten path. So no Ben
Franklin on liberty, Oppenheimer on the atomic bomb, or Kennedy on the arts.
This has the added benefit of making the page a bit shorter and easier to
update.

I'm also going to try to keep the software development and computer science
quotes to a reasonable number, but we'll see how that goes.

  > Man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun.

~ Clifford Geertz

  > Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place.
  > Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by

~ Brian Kernighan

  > I know people, I know towns, farms, hills and rivers and rocks, I know how
  > the sun at sunset in autumn falls on the side of a certain plowland in the
  > hills; but what is the sense of giving a boundary to all that, of giving it
  > a name and ceasing to love where the name ceases to apply?  What is love of
  > one's country; is it hate of one's uncountry? Then it's not a good thing. Is
  > it simply self-love? That's a good thing, but one mustn't make a virtue of
  > it, or a profession....

~ Estraven, from The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin
