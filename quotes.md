I'm a fan of interesting things that other people have said. I've collected a
few of them below.  Some are witty, some are wise, and some are funny (for
various reasons). I had a web page like this back in college and I looked for
the files, but alas, they have been lost to the sands of time and my own
carelessness.

I'm going to try to stick to quotes that are off the beaten path. So no Ben
Franklin on liberty, Oppenheimer on the atomic bomb, or Kennedy on the arts.
This has the added benefit of making the page a bit shorter and easier to
update.

I'm also going to try to keep the software development and computer science
quotes to a reasonable number, but we'll see how that goes.
